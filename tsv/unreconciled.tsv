"The user is retweeting a young man who is sharing that it is his birthday. I believe he is referring to a friend who had died with Longlivebankroll he includes a bag of money emoji and ghost emoji to further represent longlivebankroll. He asks for him to look over him and protect him on his birthday. He includes a no 18 emoji after most likely representing that he is no longer under 18. The user also included a picture of himself. The user retweeted him and added 'lil cuz' as a term of endearment with a sunglasses emoji and battery emoji. The emoji's may be referring to the young man saying he looks cool and charged up.

He includes two 100 emojis and says GAIN followers on TITYFOLLOTRAIN tonight with two hearts emoji possibly meaning to show the love. He includes two young women twitter accounts who he says to follow. After their names he includes a face with heart eyes and an ok hand emoji most likely expressing love for the two women and that they are worth following. He says to retweet TITYFOLLOWTRAIN with a train emoji. Then he adds ""Gain fast"" meaning this may be a fast way to gain followers with a man running emoji. 300__agent most likely retweeted the tweet to help the women gain followers and to possibly help himself gain followers.

The photo appears to look like a mugshot on the news. The user remarks that the woman is snitching on everybody. I believe this is made to be a joke that because the woman is crying and looks upset she is going to snitch or tell the cops whatever she needs to to get out of trouble. The user adds a crying emoji to represent he's crying he's laughing so hard. In addition to the link the user includes 3 emojis. The on arrow emoji might represent snitching on or pointing fingers at people or giving names. The baby emoji may be being used to represent that she's a baby. And the crying emoji expresses that the user finds this hilarious. The user mostly likely found the post funny and wanted to share it on his timeline.
