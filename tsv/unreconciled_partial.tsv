Tooka seems to be a friend of the retweeter and an opp of the person being retweeted. The person retweeting added a message that is disrespecting the death of the person being retweeting by saying that he is dead because he disrespected Tooka and Zans. He is using the person who has been killed as an example saying this is what disrespecting people he knows will get you. It will get you killed. It serves as both a diss and a warning to anyone else who is thinking about disrespecting his crew and the people affiliated with his crew.	2017-03-21 21:28:55.290864			f	[]

77	694727980216557569	Kyle	This tweet seems to be about acceptable roles one might play in various systems. Telling someone that they can't be a customer in the game appears to imply that you can't be someone who takes what is given or doesn't contribute. This could apply to a wide variety of things but may apply to selling drugs can't be a user need to be a mover. Music can't sit back and appreciate what others are doing you need to get out there and produce your own stuff. Life in general be in charge.	["supply"]	["notsure"]	f	0.0	This does not have any threatening qualities about it. Appears to be more of a mantra or suggestion.

78	694792343463985152	Kyle	Boss Top tweets out a lyric from Kodak Black this might be a lyric he enjoys from the song or may be a lyric in relation to something going on in his personal life.

82	695608608768151552	Kyle	Boss Top tweets out a lyric from a Young Thug song. The lyric its self could have something to do with being a known killer/mover in your respective neighborhood and not being worried about going to a controlled prison unit. Maybe the lyric is supposed to imply that the individual has so much clout credibility and associated body count in their neighborhood that they'll never have to worry about going to any kind of penitentiary. This could be because of their contacts and ability to evade law enforcement or because they are willing to go down in gun fire before getting sent to prison.

"T'Upp" meaning turn up which is another way to say getting crazy in order to have fun. He says "my shxt next" which I took as his birthday celebration was coming up.

Tutu remains a popular figure in IBD with numerous people making reference to him in songs and informally taking on the name Tutu gang. Popular rapper Chief Keef has  made fun of Tutu in a couple of his songs adding further fuel to the fire. 2-21 is the birthdate of Tutu which also happens to be younggodumbs birthday for this reason younggodumbs birthday appears to have even more significance.	2017-05-08 08:12:15.833242	["PRIDE","SAD","DEATH","RETWEET"]		f	["Loss", "Other", "Aggression"]

425	833737258519904257	Kyle	This is another tweet in a conversation about younggodumb wanting prettynuski_ to leave him alone. This tweet comes after he tweeted at her to go away she responded by asking what she did (and laughed). This post appears to be a non comical response where he directly lets her know that he has no business talking or interacting with her in any way.	["supply"]	["neg_sentiment"]	t	0.0	This is just a more forceful way of younggodumb telling prettynuski_ that he has no intentions of interacting with her. No threat was made.	Continuing a previous conversation younggodumb tells prettynuski_ that he has no plans on interacting with her. It is a very direct and possibly offensive comment. The text makes it seem like the two of them have had problems before and she knows that he doesn't like her.	2017-05-18 17:00:50.757019	["GEN","CONVO"]		f	["Other"]
